                        My name is Nathan Wassem. I am pursuing a career in software development. I am in 11th grade at the time of making this and have my eyes set on being engaged in dual enrollment my 12th grade year. I am proficient in Python and HTML/CSS. I became fluent in Python because of a computer science class taken during 2018-2019. HTML/CSS is the second language I have become fluent in. This is in part because of my internship with MaxxPotential. During the time in my internship, I have developed a skill in debugging, which is useful in many situations. I hope to learn C++, C, and Java. I also have skills I learned outside of computer science such as guitar, photo shop, and video editing. I have work experience as a cashier, IT worker, and as a website developer.
